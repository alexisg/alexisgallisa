Source code for my personal site previsouly built with [Webhook CMS](https://github.com/webhook/webhook-cms). Webhook was a static site generator which allowed me to build sites using Danjo like templating via SwigJS and provided a locally run cms which allowed for custom forms to be built specific to this site. It was incredible! Sadly webhook closed down due to large changes made in the Firebase service which the developers were dependent on. 

This code lives here for posterity as it included some at the time great usage of sass/scss, video serving through modenizr detection, and a single page app experience built using [smoothstatejs](https://github.com/miguel-perez/smoothState.js).
